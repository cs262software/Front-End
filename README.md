To install from scratch.

1) Create a "theatre-suite" folder

2) Open up a terminal, if you don't have one open already, and cd into that folder.

3) Pull the master branch on GIT.
(Run "git clone <git url>")
You will know you did this correctly when you see a "front-end" folder within the "theatre-suite" folder you created.

4) cd into the "front-end" folder and run "npm install". This will install larger dependency files that are not worth storing in git.

5) Checkout a new working branch.

6) Make yo changes.

7) To test, run "npm start" from within the "front-end" folder.

8) When you finish, push the changes to YOUR BRANCH. Matt or Megan will approve them before they are merged back into the master branch.
